React To-Do List Application
This is a simple To-Do List application built with React. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The application persists data in the browser's local storage, ensuring that tasks are saved even after the page is refreshed.

Features 
1. Add New Tasks: Users can add tasks with a title and description.
2. Edit Tasks: Users can edit the title and description of existing tasks.
3. Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks from the to-do list.
4. Mark Tasks as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed, and move them to a separate completed tasks list.
5. View Completed Tasks: Users can view a list of completed tasks along with the date and time of completion.
6. Persist Data: The application uses local storage to persist tasks, so they are not lost on page refresh.


System Design

The application is built using React for the front end. Tasks are stored in a dummy JSON file named todos.json inside the data folder in src.
